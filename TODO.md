# TODO

* Change prop values to match the prop-value/propValue thing between passing and declaring
* Get start dates for month and week/day working better together. Figure out what should happen, I.E. should changing to month reset the date for week/day to start of that month, or keep it closer to what was looked at last
* Might need better handling of week start if first day of month falls on a saturday (ie july 31st is saturday, week goes from 26 mon - 30 fri)
* Add ability to add css classes for events
* Move js function files to new directory
* tidy components folder
* Should probably add an end date option for events
* Remove groups from options and make it a level higher as resources
* Add eslinting to project using standard formatting version
